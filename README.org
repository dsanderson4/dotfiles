This repository contains configuration files, and tries to be cross-platform
where possible:

The fonts and scripts directories contain support files.

For platforms other than Windows, GNU Stow (package name "stow") can be used to
create the necessary symbolic links for emacs, vim, kitty, and i3. In Windows,
there are "link.ps1" scripts to create symbolic links for emacs, vim, and
vsvim. These scripts assume that this repository is cloned to ~/dotfiles; also
they depend on a PowerShell "sudo" script that can be found here:
[[https://github.com/lukesampson/psutils]].

See README files in subfolders for further details.
