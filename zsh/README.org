* Z Shell Settings

I use Oh My Zsh as a framework for zsh; the ohmy.sh script installs it.

I use the default .zshrc, except that I cange the theme to "agnoster". This
theme wants a PowerLine font; I use "Lucdica Console for PowerLine" in my
terminals.

Oh My Zsh automatically runs all .zsh files in ~/.oh-zsh/custom. The .zsh files
in this repository should be selectively copied into the custom directory,
depending on the environment:

- all.zsh: All environments.

- wsl.zsh: All WSL enviromments.

- wsl1.zsh: WSL 1 only.

- wsl2.zsh: WSL 2 only.
